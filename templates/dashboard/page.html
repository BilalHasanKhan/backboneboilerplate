<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There are many boiler plates for Backbone.js boilerplates popping up over the place with different philosophies. 
This solution aims to be absolutely light-weight and robust keeping the following points in mind;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand on the shoulders of giants (Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Require.js, Html5Boilerplate) </li>
  <li>Perpetuate great and efficient practises for single page applications</li>
  <li>Optimized deployment consisting of one js file, one image sprite and one css file (with exceptions)</li>
  <li>One command optimization</li>
  <li>No enforced pre-compilation creating a low entry barrier to starting</li>
  <li>Modular enviroment (reusable, isolated testing)</li>
  <li>Speed!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
